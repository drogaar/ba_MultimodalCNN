# ba_MultimodalCNN
Observing the effect of multimodality on convolutional neural networks.

Keras/theano is not deterministic of itself. Therefore, any experiments cannot be reproduced exactly. Seeds were set to get results as close to the original results and overal results should be similar. 

IMPORTANT: When training a model make sure the path used for saving models (read: any path) in is correct! If the specified folder does not exist, training will occur but no models will be saved.
