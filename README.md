# ba_MultimodalCNN
Observing the effect of multimodality on convolutional neural networks.

Seeds were set to get results as close to the original results and overal results should be similar. However, full reproducibility of results should be guaranteed in the future.

IMPORTANT: When training a model make sure the path used for saving models (read: any path) in is correct! If the specified folder does not exist, training will occur but no models will be saved.
